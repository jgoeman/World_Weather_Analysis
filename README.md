# World_Weather_Analysis

## Description
The goal of this analysis is to develop a simple app that will help customers chose destinations that they would like to visit based off the weather of a given area. Cities around the world were chosen at random to give an idea of temperature and other weather factors in a given area.    

Customers are set up to enter temperature information and then suggestions of where they might want to travel are given along with a top hotel choice. Different visualizations were used to help the customer better make there choices. One such tool is a map set up to show locations they may want to visit with markers including the city, weather, and hotel that they could chose.

Another tool added is the ability to plan a vacation travel itinerary and dislplay the travel route along with markers to including city weather and hotel information.
